# SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

- `tictactoe/v1.py`: Implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game using functions.
- `tictactoe/v2.py`: Implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game using classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/codewithjohnson/tic-tac-toe.git
    cd tictactoe
    ```

2. Run the function-based version:

    ```sh
    python tictactoe/v1.py
    ```

3. Run the class-based version:

    ```sh
    python tictactoe/v2.py
    ```

## Learning Objectives

### Function-Based Implementation (`v1.py`)

In the function-based implementation, you will learn how to:

- Define and call functions.
- Use control flow statements like `if`, `else`, and `while`.
- Handle user input and output.
- Implement game logic using functions.

### Class-Based Implementation (`v2.py`)

In the class-based implementation, you will learn how to:

- Define and instantiate classes.
- Use instance variables and methods.
- Implement game logic using object-oriented programming principles.
- Understand the benefits of encapsulation and code reusability.
